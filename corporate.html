			 <h4>Vision</h4>
			<p class="body-text">In a world where genuine connection is harder to find, we firmly believe that individuals perform best when they are part of a community because only then supportive networks can form, inspiring them to attain their goals with confidence and determination.</p>
			
          	<h4>Values</h4>
			<p class="body-text">Togetherness: Shuttle Mates is about being together. We give a sport that is viewed as an individual sport a team spirit. Our badminton players form close-knit friendships through our brand, creating an environment for our players to feel connected and supported.</p>
		  <p class="body-text">Community: Out of the friendships that are formed we built a community. We provide a place to fall back on, share experiences and celebrate wins. We create a space to be a part of something.</p>
		  <p class="body-text">Passion: We work to keep our players passionate about badminton by encouraging them to not only excel in badminton but also find enjoyment in the sport. Passion is key for players to stay motivated in bettering themselves.</p>
		  <p class="body-text">Improvement: We believe in growth, both as a badminton player and a team player. We do this by creating opportunities for them to challenge themselves and learn from these challenges. </p>
			
			<h4>Brand Persona</h4>
			<p class="body-text">A possible persona is George. George is a 21 year old guy who studies Logistics in Breda. He is originally from Zaandam and moved to Breda a year ago for his study. He lives in a student house where he has to pay €495,- (Diender, 2022). He gets funding from the government which amounts to €439,20 (Veranderingen studiefinanciering: basisbeurs terug - DUO, z.d.). He has a job at a lunch room where he serves customers which gets him a monthly allowance of  €478.80 (Ministerie van Algemene Zaken, 2023). </p>

			<p class="body-text">George is a very active guy. Back in Zaandam he used to play badminton three times a week with his local team. In that club he also used to coach a younger badminton team, since he loved the community spirit. He knows the struggles of finding that like-minded community, so he loved creating that in his old club. He is looking for a new badminton team to pursue his passion again. 


			<p class="body-text">While studying in Breda, he got a gym membership at a local student gym where he spends most of his free time. To get inspiration for workouts he follows ‘Gymfluencers’ on TikTok. He has a strong media usage and follows multiple badminton players on both Instagram and Tiktok. He is influenced by the Gymfluencers to buy brands like Gymshark, Aybl and Nike. He mostly spends time on social media during breaks at university and after the gym around 21:00. Since it can get quite lonely in this new city, he likes to travel back to Zaandam on the weekend to spend time with his family, friends and old team players, often travelling by train. </p> 

			<p class="body-text">The main obstacle George encounters is the fact that he doesn’t know anyone in the neighbourhood of Breda who plays badminton and so he started fitness in the gym. Still he is more of a team player since he likes to have his own community where he feels safe. He gets a lot of energy from sports and feels the most comfortable in a group of people who play in the same field. Therefore, he is really looking for badminton players who play at his level to start playing badminton again. </p>

          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
			<p>Colour Scheme</p>
          <p class="body-text">The chosen colours fit our brand perfectly because of the nice combination and contrast of the light and darker colours. With our brand, we want to express fun and passion and with all these bright colours we express an energetic feeling. Since our brand is about matching badminton players, the colours also refer to the floors in the sports halls they play in. The lines on the ground are primarily coloured and we wanted to bring that also into our color scheme. Every colour has its feeling.</p>
          <em class="body-text">&mdash; These are our colours:</em>
              <ul class="list-unstyled body-text">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EC763E;"></span>
                  #EC763E
				  </li>
				  <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #BBBDF6;"></span>
                  #BBBDF6
				  </li>
				  <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #5438DC;"></span>
                  #5438DC
				  </li>
				  <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #A20021;"></span>
                  #A20021
				  </li>
				  <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EDEDF4;"></span>
                  #EDEDF4
				  </li>
				  </ul>
			<p class="body-text">Orange, with its vibrant and energetic aura, is associated with enthusiasm, creativity, and determination. Red is often associated with energy, power, intensity and competitiveness. Blue is symbolizing trust, stability, and reliability. Blue aims to convey a sense of professionalism and confidence. And lastly white is related to calmness, visibility and contrast which we want to implement to not create a too overwhelming look. Together, these colours form a cohesive palette that embodies the diverse emotions and qualities that we want to express with our brand.</p>
            
			
			<p>Font Choices</p>
			<p class="body-text">For the font, we also wanted to express confidence in contrast with a fun look. We used the header font ‘Impact’ which is a really clear and steady font to use for titles. For the subheading, we used a more playful font which is called ‘Knewave’. This font looks handwritten and gives a more personal touch. In combination with the title this is a perfect fit. Lastly, for the body text, we used a round-shaped font that is called ‘Corporative’. Round shapes convey a sense of playfulness, creativity and also trust. This makes all fonts a good combination for the expression of our brand. </p>

			
			<p>User Interface Elements</p>
			<p class="body-text">Repetition and emphasising the call to action have been the main focus of this website. Using buttons in highly visual “Hero sections” entices the end customer to covert. The customers are given multiple opportunities throughout the website to download the app with the “Say Goodbye to Boring Matches” section. Forms have been embedded into the website so that the users can get their questions about the service cleared, thus creating more engagement with the brand. The call-to-action buttons as always been accompanied by a highly visual mockup to entice and carry forward the final step in converting the target audience to customers.</p>
			
			<p>Organization of Navigation and Content</p>
			<p class="body-text">For the website's organisation, we decided to do a paper prototype to feel the layout and find a potential organisation. This helped us create a navigation flow that is intuitive to our target audience. This was highly important to us as our communication objective entailed users to both relate to messaging and be invited to the badminton community in Breda and install the app. This was also the reason for the repetition of information and redirects within the website.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The homepage serves as a link to everything on the website. You are first greeted by a video hero section along with an animated text, that conveys the value proposition of Shuttle Mates. After the hero section, you will find the “What We Do” section, in which we explain briefly Shuttle Mate’s purpose to redirect them to the About Us page. Further down the homepage, you can install the Shuttle Mates app right away through the “Install Now” button placed right next to a highly visual mockup that grabs the attention of the users. The “Services” page does its job by conveying both the product as well as the price points, using a centred hero section as well as a pricing section. The “About Us” page conveys the essence of Shuttle Mates by stating the vision and visually conveying the values. The “Contact Us” page enables users to get in touch with us to clear their doubts about our services.</p>

			<p>Testing Goals</p>
			<p class="body-text">To make sure we got an optimal result from testing, we set certain goals:</p>

			<p>Testing Methods</p>
			<p class="body-text">To make the testing applicable for our website, we asked five participants between the ages 18 and 25 who play badminton to test our website. This way our testers matched our target audience: students from the municipality of Breda between ages 18 and 25, gender not specified. We showed them a draft version of our website (github link) where they could find our main information. The tests were conducted by two members of Shuttle Mates, one for the questions and the other for video recordings. We asked them questions that can be found below under ‘Testing tasks and questions’.</p>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p class="body-text">Our brand ‘Shuttle Mates’ brings individuals together to play badminton in the form of an app where individuals can play their ideal game. Out of the insights we got from our target audience we noticed that the biggest problem they encountered was that they were struggling to find a partner on the same level. An important factor that they found in this sport was the community-related aspect around it. The brand values created out of these insights are togetherness, community, passion and improvement. Our multifunctional app not only facilitates game organisation based on individual expectations and experiences but also fosters post-game interactions through a chat function, promoting further plays and socialisation.</p>
		  <p class="body-text">The target audience we want to focus on is individuals between the ages of 18 and 25 years old. These individuals are particularly students with part-time jobs who are playing badminton for fun besides school and work. As they are part of Gen Z, they have a strong media usage. These individuals feel connected to the badminton community in the municipality of Breda. They seek social interaction while staying active in sports, indicating their desire to find their ideal badminton partner.</p>
		  <p class="body-text">We targeted our focus to the municipality of Breda and created our reach objective to a realistic number of 200 individuals. There are a total of 23.095 students in Breda. We assume that 5% of these students would play badminton, giving us 1155 students. The number 200 will be the estimated number of people we can reach in this period of time. For our affect objective, we aimed for our target audience to connect with the community feeling and we planned on measuring this by the average watch duration. We expected 10 target customers to visit our website which formed our response objective. </p>
		  <p class="body-text">The age group that we are targeting is highly active on Instagram and TikTok, and since we are focusing on organic growth, using short-form content on these platforms would enable us to communicate the brand values easily. We designed posts that match the style of our brand and implemented our fonts, bright colours and design elements to create a playful and attractive-looking appearance. With that in mind, we planned our content carefully, with posts relatable to these topics: first brand announcement (awareness), second community-focused (interest), third platform values (desire), and lastly platform reveal (action). This approach helped us to create relatable content in the right way to attract our target audience.</p>
			
		  <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p class="body-text">The most important learning point we noticed while setting up the brand was that the reach of our objectives was too big in the beginning. We wanted to reach 21.000 people, however, as starters in a short time period it is most important to set a realistic and reachable objective. We shifted our focus to the municipality of Breda and refined our objectives accordingly. Furthermore, our expectations did not meet the result of our response objective. Our goal was to get 10 target customers to our website but by checking Google analytics we found 5 users visited our website, which is lower than the response objective. This shows how crucial it is to set realistic and achievable goals and to research our target audiences’ behaviours.</p>
          
			
			
		  <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p class="body-text">We increased our platform's reach by following many users and sharing short-form content videos. This helped us a lot with creating awareness and it was a good way for organic growth, which is good because our brand is community-focused. The funny videos appealed to our young target audience, especially the TikTok trends we used were recognizable to them because they spend a lot on that platform nowadays. These videos got more views compared to the Instagram posts. The average attention span is 2 to 3 seconds, and our videos were around 10 seconds long. This meant that the idea of the video and tone of voice connected with our target audience causing them to watch the video for a long duration which succeeded our affect objective. </p>
			
          <p class="body-text">This made a performance on both our TikTok and Instagram. On Instagram, we reached 435 accounts, far exceeding our goal of 200. Our reels were particularly popular and were seen by many people who didn't even follow us. Also, on TikTok we got more than 1000 views on both videos. This is a positive result for our reach objective and is therefore a good strategy to use for future planning.</p>
			

          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p class="body-text">We made an Excel planner to map out our content. Each idea is detailed, specifying the platform, format, day, and necessary descriptions. We scheduled 4 posting per week over 4 weeks, giving us a clear plan of who is doing what and when it will be posted. Each week served a purpose as the content in each week was reflective to the AIDA model.</p>
			
		  <p class="body-text">For the first posts, we created a brand announcement with our logo and an explanation of who we are. In the same week, we posted an interactive story to ask what badminton player they are to show them that they belong to the community of our app. To grab their interest, we made funny relatable trend videos on TikTok and Instagram reels. To create desire, we announced the date of the launch of our app and the reasons why they should download it and made a call-to-action post to tell our target audience to download it.</p>

          <h2 id="management" class="mt-5">Management</h2>

          <h4 id="management-1" class="mt-2">Lean Canvas 3</h4>
			<div class="object-fit-scale pb-4">
                    <img src="images/lean-canvas-3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="shuttle mates mockup" width="1000" height="800">
          </div>

          <p>Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <p class="body-text">For this project, we have conducted multiple interviews with badminton players. Problem interviews, which aim to identify the problem within our target audience, and solution interviews, which give feedback on the solutions we have developed, below are the problems that we have come across in our interviews. The first problem we thought of was not being able to find players who play on the same level. After the problem interviews, this hypothesis was confirmed. All the interviewees mentioned that they prefer to play with people who are on the same level. Some of them brought up the topic of finding it difficult to seek out players on their level.</p>
						  <ul class="pb-3">
						  <li class="body-text ">A current solution to this problem is joining a badminton club and letting a coach decide on your level. However, we believe that the players themselves should also have a say. </li>
						  <li class="body-text">Another option to play people on the same level is joining a competition. They will put you up against someone on your level.</li>
						  <li class="body-text">There are also apps where you can find sports players nearby like Rovo and FindYourFit (FindYourFit, 2024),(Rovo - Find Sports Player Nearby, n.d.)
						  </li>
						  </ul>
			  
			  <p class="body-text">Secondly, during our problem interviews our interviewees mentioned that when you do not have good enough badminton connections, it is difficult to play badminton. Mainly for the people that have moved here from another country. Adding on to that it is hard to find more than one person to play with, which is needed for the team sport. Everyone’s schedule is different and it is hard to plan.</p>
			  
						   <ul class="pb-3">
						   <li class="body-text">Again a solution that is used now is joining a team or club. But from our interviews, we heard that the step to join one can be scary to make.</li>
						   </ul>
			  
			   <p class="body-text">The third problem we eventually encountered in the problem interviews was not having a social circle coming to a new city. Since our target audience is students, a large portion of them are either international or come from another city in the Netherlands. Moving to a new place also means meeting new friends and creating a community of like-minded people. This can be difficult for some. Multiple interviewees mentioned that they got into badminton because their friends did it and then played together. Moving away caused them to quit.</p>
			  
			  
			  			   <ul class="pb-3">
							   <li class="body-text">Current solutions are joining clubs, and associations or just going out to meet people. Nevertheless, this can be hard for people, and that is why we try to make it as easy and accessible as possible for everyone who wants to join. </li>
			               </ul>
			  
			   <p class="body-text">Lastly, in our solution interviews we have come across another problem, which is not having a sports hall to play badminton in. When you have found other people who play badminton, it does not necessarily mean that there is (enough) space to play.</p>
			  
			  
			  			   <ul class="pb-3">
							   <li class="body-text">Current solutions are renting a hall. </li>
			               </ul>			  
			</ul>
			  
          <p>Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <p class="body-text">After recognising the problems we have come up with solutions to these problems. Our solution to not finding people on the same level problem is the creation of an app that analyses all players and teams them up based on their skills, competitiveness and how much fun they want. The benefit of letting a programme analyse players and match them up is that it saves a lot of time and effort. Giving our players 24/7 fast help when wanting to play.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the problem interviews we have also come up with a solution for the loneliness and unfamiliarity of incoming students. This is the creation of a badminton community where both experienced and new players can make new friends through badminton. They can interact with one another through our app.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Through our app, we also give our users the chance to meet up and play together. Which further intensifies their friendship, solving the problem of not having a social circle. The benefits our players have are that they both get to play the sport they love and make new lasting friendships with people they would otherwise have not reached out to.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the solution interviews where we added a problem, we have come up with the solution of partnering with a local gym, Bress, and thereby can offer their sports halls to our users. We promote Bress on our app and website and in return, we get access to their sports halls. The benefit we bring to our players is that playing badminton using Shuttle Mates is a very cheap way to play badminton.</p>
		  </ul>
			
			  
          <p>Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
			<p class="body-text">We decided to target a niche market; Badminton players in and around Breda.</p>
			  
			<p>Persona</p>
			<p class="body-text">A possible persona is George. George is a 21-year-old guy who studies Logistics in Breda. He is originally from Zaandam and moved to Breda a year ago for his study. He lives in a student house where he has to pay €495,- (Diender, 2022). He gets funding from the government which amounts to €439,20 (Veranderingen studiefinanciering: basisbeurs terug - DUO, z.d.). He has a job at a lunch room where he serves customers which gets him a monthly allowance of  €478.80 (Ministerie van Algemene Zaken, 2023).</p>
			<p class="body-text">George is a very active guy. Back in Zaandam, he used to play badminton three times a week with his local team. In that club, he also used to coach a younger badminton team, since he loved the community spirit. He knows the struggles of finding that like-minded community, so he loved creating that in his old club. He is looking for a new badminton team to pursue his passion again.</p>
			<p class="body-text">While studying in Breda, he got a gym membership at a local student gym where he spends most of his free time. To get inspiration for workouts he follows ‘Gymfluencers’ on TikTok. He has a strong media usage and follows multiple badminton players on both Instagram and TikTok. He is influenced by the Gymfluencers to buy brands like Gymshark, Aybl and Nike.He mostly spends time on social media during breaks at university and after the gym around 21:00. Since it can get quite lonely in this new city, he likes to travel back to Zaandam on the weekend to spend time with his family, friends and old team players, often travelling by train.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The main obstacle George encounters is the fact that he doesn’t know anyone in the neighbourhood of Breda who plays badminton so he starts fitness in the gym. Still, he is more of a team player since he likes to have his own community where he feels safe. He gets a lot of energy from sports and feels the most comfortable in a group of people who play in the same field. Therefore, he is really looking for badminton players who play at his level to start playing badminton again.</p>			
			
			<p>Early Adopter</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the solution interview, we were able to establish the perfect early adopter. The perfect early adopters are badminton players in Breda who do not have a partner to play with on the same level as them. They lack the community spirit of badminton and are therefore constantly on the lookout for this. They are comfortable using mobile apps and meeting up with people they meet online. They are willing to improve the badminton community spirit in Breda by cooperating and giving feedback on versions of our app.</p>
          </ul>
			
			
          <p>Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
			<p class="body-text">Our Unique Value Proposition is as follows:</p>
			<p class="body-text">Shuttle Mates brings a community where badminton players can meet like-minded people with the same shared love and passion for badminton. We give an ‘’individual’’ sport a team spirit!</p>
			<p class="body-text">We create value for our customers firstly by customisation. This means we tailor our ‘content’ to personal information. In our app, we customise all their matches by their personal information. This information includes their rating statistics, but also the preference of their need for competition and socialising.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Secondly, we satisfy our customers' social needs by giving them a community of like-minded people to belong to. Therefore giving them the feeling of belonging.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lastly, we give them the option to play together and afterwards talk about it, satisfying their social integrative needs.</p>
          </ul>
			
          <p>Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
			<p class="body-text">Our unfair advantage is that we, first of all, have an in-depth knowledge of badminton players' needs. We have talked to our target audience rigorously and identified all their needs. Badminton is a sport that is not taken seriously by many. Comparing it to tennis and not recognising it as a sport. We however do not agree and see badminton as a vibrant and exciting sport.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the solution interviews, our interviewees surfaced the issue of not having a location to play at. We therefore came up with the idea to partner with the local gym BRESS. Hereby offering their sports hall for free to our members, putting us in a good position and giving us an advantage over like-minded brands. </p>
          </ul>
			
          <p>Channels</p>
          <ul>
			<p class="body-text">To reach our customers we use different platforms and services.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Awareness: Indirect partner Instagram and TikTok. We focus on content creation to create awareness. Since our target group is part of Gen Z, we focus on social media that they use, namely Instagram and TikTok. The content creation will consist of posts, reels, stories and videos. </p>
			<p class="body-text">Evaluation: Direct owned Shuttle Mates website. Customers can evaluate our brand on our website. Here they can see our values, vision, what we are about and what we deliver; our app.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Purchase: Direct-owned Shuttle Mates website and app. From the solution interviews, we got a lot of suggestions to add. We therefore saw an opportunity to add a premium version and external events. These products can be sold on our website and app. The app itself is free of use, but the premium version and external event tickets can be purchased through both the website and the app.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Delivery: Direct-owned Shuttle Mates website and indirect partners Google Store and the App Store. The delivery of the app will be through the Google Store and the App Store. The delivery of ticket sales for external events will be through the Shuttle Mates website.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After-sales: Direct owned Shuttle Mates website (FAQ and customer service) to support our customers, we provide a FAQ on our website where they can find out answers to questions. To provide more specific assistance, we offer them an online customer service where they can get in contact with a staff member. </p>
			<p class="body-text">The most important channel for communication of our Value Proposition with the customers of Shuttle Mates will be the social media platforms and the Shuttle Mates website. Here we post updates, upcoming events and inspirational messages. The most important channel for the distribution of our Value Proposition will be the Shuttle Mates app. Here our customers can meet like-minded people and create a community.</p>
          </ul>

          <p>Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
			<p class="body-text">To measure our brand experience we are planning to use numeral key metrics.</p>
			<p class="body-text">By measuring the number of downloads of the Shuttle mates app, we can measure if the app is gaining popularity and is actually getting downloaded to use. By measuring the daily visitors to the Shuttle Mates website, we can track the popularity of our brand and see if people are interested in this topic. By measuring the number of views, followers and likes on our Social Media platforms, we can see if the marketing of our brand is actually useful and attracts people. By measuring the amount of performance ratings done in the Shuttle Mates app, we can see how many people use the actual app for matches.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the solution interviews, we got a lot of suggestions to add. We found an opportunity to create a premium version to add those in. By measuring the number of subscriptions to the premium version, we can track if the app is useful and if people are interested in our premium version for add-on features.</p>
          </ul>
				
          <p>Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
			<p class="body-text">One of the ways of making revenue is by the usage of subscription fees. After the solution interviews, we saw the possibility of adding a premium subscription. From these interviews, we gathered that on average, a customer would pay €4 for the premium version a month. There are a total of 23.095 students in Breda (Avans in Cijfers | Avans Hogeschool, n.d.), (International Students | BUas.nl, 2024). We assume that 5% of these students would play badminton, giving us 1155 students. On average, 10% of customers would pay for a premium subscription, giving us 115 customers for the premium subscription (PaymentsJournal, 2020).</p>
			<p class="body-text">€4 x 12 months = €48 a year for our premium subscription.</p>
			<p class="body-text">€48 x 115 customers = €5.520 per revenue per year for the premium subscription.</p>
		    <p class="body-text">Another way we gain revenue is by advertising. We would use video advertisements on the app between the match-up screen and the end screen (SYNDICODE Marketing, 2024). On average, video advertisements make €5 (Jacob, 2023). The number of views will be 1155, meaning 5 x 1155 = €5.775 in total.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Our last way of making revenue is by using asset sales. After the solution interviews, we saw an opportunity to add external events so our customers could meet up and get to know every Shuttle Mate. Shuttle Mates organises external events four times a year. From the interviews, we found that people would only pay when it was a special event and not only match-ups. When they would pay, it would be an average of €10. From the 1.155 students in Breda who play badminton, we assume 500 would come to external events. </p>
			<p class="body-text">€10 x 4 times a year = €40 a year. </p>
			<p class="body-text">€40 x 500 = €20.000 a year on asset sale.</p>
		    <p class="body-text">This means we make a revenue of €5.520 + €5.775 + €20.000 = €31.295.</p>
          </ul>
			
          <p>Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
			<p class="body-text">We are a value-driven brand, which means we care about creating value for our customers by offering them a high degree of personalised services.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the solution interviews, we have realised the following costs:</p>
			<p class="body-text">As a new brand, we have multiple costs to cover. First and foremost, we are creating an app. To create and publish this app there are multiple costs. Simple app development costs range between 10.000 to 60.000 dollars and take 1 to 3 months (Babych, 2024). For developing the app we have estimated costs to be around €28.000 since our app does not have many complex features. These costs include coding, designing, testing and maintenance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aside from development, we need to be legally sound. This is why we will hire someone to take care of our legal issues. “New businesses should budget at least $5,000 to hire a lawyer to handle all of your business structure and legal documents” (Henderson, 2021). This means around €4.600. These legal issues include intellectual property protection, legal &amp; licensing costs, the creation of terms of service and User Agreement and Privacy and legal compliance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To make our brand and new application successful we need publication. That is where marketing costs come in. “Early-stage startups are in the initial stages of their business growth. They typically have a marketing budget of around 10% of planned annual revenue (10% of total budget or less) or roughly $5,000 to $10,000 monthly. At this stage, the primary focus is on achieving product-market fit and establishing a foothold in the market” (Elfimova, 2023). We estimate $6.000 because of our ‘smaller’ target audience. This makes around €5.500.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Then we have to list our app on both Apple Store and Google Play. “Google Play charges developers a one-time registration fee of $25 to publish an app, whereas Apple charges a $99 yearly developer fee” (Ltd, 2023). This makes €23 + €92 = €115</p>
			<p class="body-text">Additionally, we will organise events. To establish an estimation of what the costs for these events would be we have taken the costs for organising a competition. These events do not fall under our partnership with Bress and therefore we need to pay fees for renting out their halls. On average, renting a badminton hall in Breda costs around €9 an hour. Therefore we also take this number for Bress. For this competition, we would need 4 halls for 6 hours. Besides that, we would need judges and food. The judges would be volunteers and the average cost of catering is around €29 an hour (Wat Kost, n.d.). This would make 29 x 6 = €174. Taking this and other expenditures into account we estimate €1.000 from our budget to cover these costs. If we have 4 events this means €4.000.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Making our total costs for the first year 28000 + 4600 + 5500 + 115 + 4000 = €42.215</p>
			<p class="body-text">This means we would make a loss of €10.920, which is okay since we are a new upcoming brand and will make up for these costs in the following years.</p>
          </ul>
			
          <p>Services/products</p>
          <ul>
			<p class="body-text">Shuttle Mates is a brand for badminton players. We aim to bring a community around badminton where people can share their mutual love for the sport. To find the problems in this community, we held interviews with our target group. From these interviews, we found some main problems that badminton players in Breda encounter: not being able to find people to play badminton with, not having a partner on the same level, not having any halls to play in and not having a community around badminton to enjoy. To cater to these problems Shuttle Mates delivers an app! Here, badminton players can get random match-ups based on their level, find other badminton players and improve their skills. We give them a place to enjoy their sport and meet other people in the process. </p>
			<p class="body-text">This contributes to our unique value proposition because our app helps players find their match and because they get to play with many different people, they can grow their social network and create the community we are aiming for. The Shuttle Mates app fits our brand identity, because it ties into our brand vision perfectly. “In a world where genuine connection is harder to find, we firmly believe that individuals perform best when they are part of a community because only then supportive networks can form, inspiring them to attain their goals with confidence and determination.” Our app is the perfect addition to our brand. </p>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
		  <p class="body-text">Before taking interviews we made a lean canvas based on our assumptions. </p>
		  <p class="body-text">In the building block Customer Segments, we were assigned team-sport players. Afterwards, we decided to target this to Badminton players in the Netherlands, since it is a niche market and therefore easier to research. After our first set of interviews, we had a <strong> Customer Segment pivot. </strong> We changed our target segment to Badminton players in Breda because this was a better fit for our customer needs as they prefer not to travel far to play badminton. In the building block Problem, we expected badminton players to have a hard time finding players on the same level. This is because it is not a well-known sport and fewer people mean fewer people who are on your level. After our problem interviews, this hypothesis was confirmed and interviewees mentioned having a hard time finding people, but also disliking playing with people who are not on the same skill set. However, other problems that surfaced through our interviews were not having well-enough connections to find people to play with and not having a social circle since coming to a new city. Therefore we experienced a <strong>customer need pivot.</strong> We switched our main problem to finding a community, supported by not finding people on the same level.</p>
		  <p class="body-text">The unique value proposition we had is as follows: “Shuttle Mates brings a platform where users can meet other badminton players and team up by having the app analyse your skills and match you with a team player and opponents.” However, after our customer needs pivot, we saw that our value proposition was very product-based. We therefore experienced a <strong>value proposition pivot.</strong> We decided to change the unique value proposition to: “Shuttle Mates brings a community where badminton players can meet like-minded people with the same shared love and passion for badminton. We give an ‘’individual’’ sport a team spirit!”</p>
